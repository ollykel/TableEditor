# Table Editor

Hate how Google Docs can't handle tables with more than five columns? Find it
clunky when you have create a text-based spreadsheet in Google Sheets? Hate it
when two people try to edit the same thing at the same time? This table editor
is the solution for you.

## Setup

### Dependencies

The sole dependency needed to run this program is Docker. See
[docs.docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) for instructions on
installing Docker Desktop on your computer.

### Configuration

To configure the table editor, you need a .env file in the repository root. A
file named sample.env has been provided to get you started. To start, simply
copy sample.env to .env.

```
cp ./sample.env ./.env
```

Edit your .env file to set the values of the required fields, which are
commented out and marked TODO. The required fields are:

- POSTGRES\_PASSWORD: The admin password for the PostgreSQL database. NOTE:
  changing the value of this variable after first running the app for the first
  time will make the database inaccessible to other services.
- JWT\_SECRET: The signing secret for JWT authentication tokens generated by the
  REST API. Should be a random string at least 64 characters in length.

### Building and Running

One you have docker installed, you can start the app by running the following
command from the repository root:

```
docker compose up --build -d
```

In order to read the logs from any of the services that make up the table
editor, simply run the following command:

```
docker compose logs <service_name>
```

The names of the services (i.e. reverse\_proxy, rest\_api, etc.) are given in
docker-compose.yml.

Building the necessary images can be resource intensive. You should have at
least 10G of free space on your device before you run the Table Editor.

### Using the Table Editor

To use the table editor locally, just open your browser to
http://localhost:8080. If you want to use https, go to https://localhost:4430
instead.

You can replace the default http port number of 8080 by setting the environment
variable TABLE\_EDITOR\_HTTP\_PORT, either in your .env file or directly in your
shell by running the following command:

```
export TABLE_EDITOR_HTTP_PORT=<port number>
```

To replace the default https port number of 4430, set the value of the variable
TABLE\_EDITOR\_HTTPS\_PORT.
